     <article> element use for content that makes sense on its own like blogs,post and news
     Div> element used as a container for styling and grouping purposes that do not have semantic meaning
     Semantic meaning ==> HTML element used clearly defines the information and content they contain.
     Now our page is fully simplified, we have a header and an article

        1-for article we can also make another header

      All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web. In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
      about, and why you too should learn it.
    </p>

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
      <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage It's a markup language
      that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage
      (not a programming language). HTML consists of elements that describe
      different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video,
      etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites. In
      HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
      web. Here are 5 of them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
      <li>
        To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
        Worpress or Wix
      </li>
      <li>To build web applications</li>
      <li>To impress friends</li>
      <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ul>
    
    <article/> <!-- this section is for the related posts, as it is not part of the main page, but
    still related to the content we use a different container element than <article> as it is not part of the 
     part main 
     instead we use <aside> like sidebar

<!-- 
1-Container elements will help give more structure to our HTML. 

2- <strong> used for bold

3- <em> Used for italic

4- <a> anchor should alwaus have a href= link of the page.

5- <a target="_blank"> will open the link in a new page. 

6- image is self closing tag and shoud have a source like: <img src="">


7- Img should also have alt="" attribute in case photo does not load.


8- What is Semantic HTML: 

9-Semantic element is the meaning behind that element
10-not all elements are semantic
11-for example <b> does not give any meaning but it still makes the word bold
12-so it is important to know
13-  for example <strong> means important
14-<em> means emphasis 
15- all these are semantic ==> they have a meaning and describe the content they contain
16-Another example is we can use <div> instead of <nav> or <header> as div has no meaning 
17-but in HTML we can use specific html that have meaning ==> Semantic HTML ==> attaching a certain meaning to a content. 
18-We can use <div> which has no meaning and is generic to build an entire web page but we do not do that,
  that is because we want to give website and its content a meaning, so search engine optimisation can work and goolge can understand
  the content to analayize the content and weblage. it is important for accessibilities as well.
