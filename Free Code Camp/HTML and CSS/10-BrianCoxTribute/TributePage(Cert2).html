        <h3>Here is a time line of Professor Brian Cox:</h3>
        <p class="bio">
          Professor Brian Cox, a renowned British physicist and science
          communicator, has dedicated his career to making complex scientific
          concepts accessible to the public. His contributions to both research
          and science outreach have made him one of the most influential
          physicists of his generation. Here's a timeline of his remarkable
          life:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1968</strong> - Brian Cox was born in Oldham, Greater
            Manchester, where his love for science, especially physics, took
            root. Growing up in a working-class family, his curiosity about the
            universe sparked at an early age, setting the stage for his
            extraordinary career.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1985</strong> - Driven by his passion for physics, Cox moved
            to London to study at the University of Manchester, marking the
            start of his academic journey in the field that would define his
            life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1991</strong> - Brian Cox graduated with a first-class
            degree in physics from the University of Manchester, laying the
            groundwork for his future research and scientific contributions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1995</strong> - Cox completed his PhD in high-energy
            particle physics, where he focused on studying the fundamental
            particles of nature at CERN. His work on the Higgs boson was just
            the beginning of his pivotal role in modern physics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1997</strong> - Cox became part of the ATLAS collaboration
            at CERN, working on experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
            His research on the Higgs boson would go on to be crucial in one of
            the most significant discoveries in modern physics, transforming our
            understanding of the universe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2005</strong> - Brian Cox began to gain widespread
            recognition as a science communicator, hosting programs like The
            Quantum Universe and Wonders of the Solar System. His ability to
            explain complex scientific topics with clarity and enthusiasm
            quickly earned him a global following.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2008</strong> - In 2008, Cox was appointed a professor of
            particle physics at the University of Manchester. Here, he continues
            his research while also inspiring future generations of scientists
            through his lectures and outreach efforts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2010</strong> - Cox became the host of Wonders of the
            Universe, a BBC documentary series that took millions of viewers on
            a journey through space and time, exploring the origins of the
            universe and the forces that shape it. The series was a massive
            success, reinforcing his reputation as a leading science
            communicator.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2014</strong> - In 2014, Cox co-hosted The Infinite Monkey
            Cage, a science podcast that brings humor, sharp discussion, and
            expert insight into complex topics from the world of physics,
            astronomy, and beyond. The podcast continues to be one of the most
            popular science shows worldwide.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2015</strong> - Alongside his work in broadcasting, Cox
            authored several best-selling books, including Why Does E=mc²? and
            The Quantum Universe. These books aim to explain the fundamental
